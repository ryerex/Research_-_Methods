\title{Produces a Charlson Score based on the Deyo ICD-9-CM adaptation}
\usage{
deyo(input.frame)
}
\arguments{
  \item{input.frame}{This is a data frame with 5 character
  ICD-9-CM codes without decimal points.}
}
\value{
A list of one vector and 2 data frames
\item{CHARLSON.SCORE}{A vector containing the Charlson
score for each patient} \item{COMORBIDITIES}{A data frame
denoting which diagnoses each patient has with a 1}
\item{COMORBIDITIES.POINTS}{A data frame denoting which
diagnoses each patient has with the point value of that
diagnosis}
}
\description{
This function take as input a data frame structured such
that each row contains a list of ICD-9-CM codes attributed
to a single patient. The function goes from row to row
comparing the ICD-9-CM codes a patient has with the Deyo
comorbidity index diagnosis codes.  If a patient has a
diagnosis (as indicated by ICD-9-CM code) that belongs to
one of the Deyo diagnoses, then the patient is considered
to have this diagnosis. Regardless of how many different
ICD-9-CM codes a patient has corresponding to a particular
comorbidity category, a comorbidity is only counted once.
}
\details{
The value returned consists of a vector and two data
frames. The vector is the total Charlson score.  In the
first data frame returned each row in the data frame is
devoted to a particular patient, and each column is a
diagnosis.  The data frame codes a 0 if the patient does
not have that diagnosis and 1 if the patient does have that
diagnosis.  The second data frame, which codes the point
value of that particular diagnosis in the Charlson score
rather than a 1.

The ICD-9-CM codes must be 5 characters long and have no
decimal poinst.If any codes are less than 5 digits, then
they must be led by zeroes or followed by the letter "X" to
create a 5 character code.  No more than 2 "X" ' s can be
used at the tail end, or a meaningful ICD-9-CM code cannot
be derived.  If your ICD-9-CM codes contain decimals or
some other filler character, then they must be converted to
the format above for this function to work properly.

  This function is deprecated. We recommend you switch to
  the more general \code{\link{cmrbdt.calc}} function
  instead.
