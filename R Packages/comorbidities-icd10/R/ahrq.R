#' Produces a comorbidity count based on the AHRQ comorbidity index v3.6, based
#' on the Elixhauser method
#' 
#' This function take as input a data frame structured such that each row
#' contains a list of ICD-9-CM codes attributed to a single patient. The
#' function goes from row to row comparing the ICD-9-CM codes a patient has
#' with the AHRQ comorbidity index diagnosis codes.  If a patient has a
#' diagnosis (as indicated by ICD-9-CM code) that belongs to one of the AHRQ
#' diagnoses, then the patient is considered to have this diagnosis.
#' Regardless of how many different ICD-9-CM codes a patient has corresponding
#' to a particular comorbidity category, a comorbidity is only counted once.
#' 
#' The value returned consists of a vector and a data frames. The vector is the
#' total comorbidity count.  In the data frame returned each row in the data
#' frame is devoted to a particular patient, and each column is a diagnosis.
#' The data frame codes a 0 if the patient does not have that diagnosis and 1
#' if the patient does have that diagnosis.
#' 
#' The ICD-9-CM codes must be 5 characters long and have no decimal poinst.If
#' any codes are less than 5 digits, then they must be led by zeroes or
#' followed by the letter "X" to create a 5 character code.  No more than 2 "X"
#' ' s can be used at the tail end, or a meaningful ICD-9-CM code cannot be
#' derived.  If your ICD-9-CM codes contain decimals or some other filler
#' character, then they must be converted to the format above for this function
#' to work properly.
#' 
#' @section Warning:
#' This function is deprecated. We recommend you switch to the more general
#' \code{\link{cmrbdt.calc}} function instead.
#' 
#' @param input.frame This is a data frame with 5 character ICD-9-CM codes
#' without decimal points. This can also be provided as a vector or matrix.
#' @return A list of one vector and one data frames \item{COMORBIDITY.CT}{A
#' vector containing the number of comorbidtities for each patient}
#' \item{COMORBIDITIES}{A data frame denoting which diagnoses each patient has
#' with a 1}
