#' Checks if it is ICD-9 or ICD-10
#' 
#' Identifies if first letter is a number or V and then suggests ICD-9. 
#' There are V-codes in ICD-10 although these are only transportation related
#' disease causes such as biking and automobile accidents. It is therefore better
#' to sort any of these codes into the ICD-9 in case they actually belong there.
#' 
#' @section Important note:
#' The E-code for the "SUPPLEMENTARY CLASSIFICATION OF EXTERNAL CAUSES 
#' OF INJURY AND POISONING (E800-E999)" are not included in the icd-9 as they
#' are part of the metabolic spectra for ICD-10. Likewise the V-codes are defaulted
#' to ICD-9.
#' 
#' @param codes A vector with ICD-codes
#' @param icd_ver A vector with icd versions, has to have the length of
#'  1 or the same length as \code{code} argument. If FALSE then all are 
#'  checked otherwise only those that are FALSE are checked.
#' @return \code{vector} Returns a vector of the same length as the codes
#'  whith a number corresponding to to the ICD-version.
